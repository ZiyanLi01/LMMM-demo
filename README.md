# LMMM-demo
In this project, I developed a Lightweight (Bayesian) Marketing Mix Modeling to predict future sales using historical advertising data across multiple media channels. Although the actual business data was confidential, I used experimental data to demonstrate the functionality of the code. The model aimed to help business owners measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns and allocate their advertising budgets more efficiently.
